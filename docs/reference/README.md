# Reference

### Operations
Like most programming languages you can add `+`, subtract `-`, divide `/`, multiply `*`, and do powers `^` of numbers. You can also add strings together using the `+` operator. For other objects, this behaviour is defined in their section of the reference. Coming from python it may seem weird to use `^` as power because that is bitwise xor. However, this language doesn't have bitwise operations so it makes more sense than `**`.
