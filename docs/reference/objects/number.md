# Number

There is no `int` or `float` type. They are both represented by `Number`. However, the underlying python will stay as an int as long as possible for the sake of accuracy. To access PI just use the keyword `PI` in your code. `true` and `false` represent 1 and 0 respectively. In addition, `null` is 0 when working with numbers.

The following statments are true:
- `true + false == 1`
- `6 + 7 = 13`
- `null == 0`
- `null - true == -1`
