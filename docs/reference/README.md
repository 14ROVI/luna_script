# Reference

### Operations
Like most programming languages you can add `+`, subtract `-`, divide `/`, multiply `*`, and do powers `^` of numbers. You can also add strings together using the `+` operator. For other objects, this behaviour is defined in their section of the reference. Coming from python it may seem weird to use `^` as power because that is bitwise xor. However, this language doesn't have bitwise operations so it makes more sense than `**`.


### Functions
You can define your own functions and use inbuilts. To see how to define your own visit [functions/define](functions/define). Otherwise the inbuilts are listed below.
#### Inbuilts
- [`str`](functions/str)
- [`isnum`](functions/isnum)
- ...

### Objects
There is no way to make your own classes or objects in Luna script; you are limited by what we give you. This means there is only refernce on how to use them, all the objects you can access will be created for you.
- [`Number`](objects/number)
- [`Interaction`](objects/interaction)
- [`Guild`](objects/guild)
- [`Member`](objects/member)
- [`User`](objects/user)
- ...
